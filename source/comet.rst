CoMet Toolkit
=============

The `CoMet Toolkit`_ (Community Metrology Toolkit) is an initiative to develop open-source tools to support the handling of error-covariance information in the analysis of measurement data.

CoMet's `obsarray`_ is python package - which extends to the popular data handling `xarray`_ package - to support defining, storing and interfacing with error-covariance information using these Uncertainty Metadata Conventions. CoMet provide example jupyter notebooks to illustrate how you can implement these tools.
