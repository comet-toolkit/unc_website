Uncertainty Metadata Naming Conventions (UNC)
=============================================

The goal of these metadata naming conventions is to provide a standardised format for storing the accompanying uncertainty/error-covariance information with measurement datasets. This format is intended to support fully capturing the content of the error-covariance matrices associated with measurement data in a compact structure, by parameterising error-covariance with a simple set of metadata.

This work is part of the `CoMet Toolkit`_ (community metrology toolkit) initiative, which includes Python tools to support it's implementation.
