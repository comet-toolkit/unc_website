Governance
**********

For the time being, the governance process around the developed of this standard is relatively simple. This of the standard is managed by the `Lead Author`_ team.

The following process is followed for new proposals:

1. New proposals are to be made in `GitHub project`_'s `Issues`_. Within the proposal's issue a discussion is encouraged to refine the proposal.
2. Each proposal should be developed in a separate branch from the current working draft branch (i.e., branching from `draft-vX.X`).
3. When complete a `Pull Request`_ should be made to request merging into the working draft branch (i.e., merging into `draft-vX.X`), with a description of the included changes.
4. The `Lead Author`_ team reviews the proposal and Approves/Rejects the Pull Request.
5. At release milestones the working draft branch is merged into the main branch and a new draft branch is created.

Simple corrections for errors can be suggested by create an Issue on the GitHub and the `Lead Author`_ team will attempt to address them promptly.
